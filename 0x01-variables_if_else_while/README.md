# 0x01-variables_if_else_while

This folder contains C programs that demonstrate the usage of variables, if-else statements, and while loops. Each program focuses on different aspects of these topics.

## List of Programs

- [0-positive_or_negative.c](0-positive_or_negative.c): This program determines whether a randomly generated number is positive or negative.
- [1-last_digit.c](1-last_digit.c): This program prints the last digit of a randomly generated number and checks if it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.
- [100-print_comb3.c](100-print_comb3.c): This program prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers without repetition.
- [101-print_comb4.c](101-print_comb4.c): This program prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers without repetition.
- [102-print_comb5.c](102-print_comb5.c): This program prints all possible combinations of two pairs of two-digit numbers without repetition.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](2-print_alphabet.c): This program prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](3-print_alphabets.c): This program prints the alphabet in lowercase followed by uppercase.
- [4-print_alphabt.c](4-print_alphabt.c): This program prints the alphabet in lowercase except for the letters 'q' and 'e'.
- [5-print_numbers.c](5-print_numbers.c): This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10.
- [6-print_numberz.c](6-print_numberz.c): This program prints all single-digit numbers of base 10 without using any variable of type char.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](7-print_tebahpla.c): This program prints the alphabet in reverse order, in lowercase.
- [8-print_base16.c](8-print_base16.c): This program prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- [9-print_comb.c](9-print_comb.c): This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
