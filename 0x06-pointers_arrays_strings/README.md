# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings in low-level programming.

## Files

- `0-strcat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings.
- `1-strncat.c`: Function that concatenates two strings, but limits the concatenation to a specific number of bytes.
- `2-strncpy.c`: Function that copies a string.
- `3-strcmp.c`: Function that compares two strings.
- `4-rev_array.c`: Function that reverses the content of an array of integers.
- `5-string_toupper.c`: Function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
- `6-cap_string.c`: Function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a string.
- `7-leet.c`: Function that encodes a string into "1337" (Leet) language.
- `100-rot13.c`: Function that encodes a string using the rot13 algorithm.
- `101-print_number.c`: Function that prints an integer.
- `102-magic.c`: Program that prints a[2] = 98, using pointer magic.
- `103-infinite_add.c`: Function that adds two numbers.
- `104-print_buffer.c`: Function that prints the content of a buffer.

## Usage

To use these functions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the desired C file(s) along with your main program using a C compiler.
3. Link the compiled files and run the resulting executable.

For example, to use the `0-strcat.c` function, you can compile it with your main program as follows:

```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-main.c 0-strcat.c -o strcat```
