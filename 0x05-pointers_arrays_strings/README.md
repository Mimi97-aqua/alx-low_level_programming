# 0x05-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains solutions for tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings in low-level programming.

## Files

- `0-reset_to_98.c`: Function that takes a pointer to an integer as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
- `1-swap.c`: Function that swaps the values of two integers.
- `2-strlen.c`: Function that returns the length of a string.
- `3-puts.c`: Function that prints a string, followed by a new line.
- `4-print_rev.c`: Function that prints a string in reverse.
- `5-rev_string.c`: Function that reverses a string.
- `6-puts2.c`: Function that prints every other character of a string, starting from the first character.
- `7-puts_half.c`: Function that prints the second half of a string.
- `8-print_array.c`: Function that prints elements of an array of integers.
- `9-strcpy.c`: Function that copies a string.
- `100-atoi.c`
- `101-keygen.c`

## Usage

To use these functions, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the desired C file(s) along with your main program using a C compiler.
3. Link the compiled files and run the resulting executable.

For example, to use the `0-reset_to_98.c` function, you can compile it with your main program as follows:

```gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic 0-main.c 0-reset_to_98.c -o reset```

Make sure to replace `0-main.c` with the name of your main program or the file where you want to use the function.
